SE (Searchable Encryption) is a perfect way to keep users’ 
sensitive data safe besides keyword-search ability on the 
server-side. SE allows searching on encrypted data without leaking information in the original data. The two main 
branches of SE are SSE and PEKS (Bösch et al. 2014; Kim 
et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2016). SSE (Searchable Symmetric 
Encryption) is the symmetric type of encryption that uses a 
private key for each user. In this manner, the user having the 
private key is able to produce encrypted documents and to 
create trapdoors for search. On the other hand, PEKS (Public 
key Encryption with Keyword Search) is the asymmetric 
type of encryption that uses a public key for all the users, 
but only the user with the private key can create trapdoors 
for search.
Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) allows the user 
to store the data in an encrypted form on a semi-honest 
server/storage provider (e.g., a cloud provider), such that this 
encrypted data remains searchable without decrypting and 
without leaking the original data content or the words being 
searched for to the server. In most cases, this is achieved by 
introducing a searchable encrypted index, which is stored 
together with the encrypted data (e. g., documents) on a 
server. To enable the server to query the data, the client 
creates a trapdoor that allows the server to do the search on 
behalf of the client.
This current paper is interested in a searchable symmetric 
encryption scheme scenario shown in Fig. 1. The scenario 
includes mainly four entities: data owner, data user, cloud 
service provider, and key generator (Bösch et al. 2014; 
Mohamad et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2016). In this scenario, 
a data owner wants to store a set of documents on a cloud 
server because of the limitation of storage resources (or any 
other reasons). As any server has a problem with privacy, 
the owner has to encrypt the documents before uploading 
them. The data and metadata are encrypted with a cryptographic scheme that enables searching capability. If either 
the data owner or a licensed user needs to get specifc documents, the user will need to submit some information in 
terms of query keywords to the cloud service provider. Upon 
receiving the encrypted search queries from the data user, 
the cloud service provider tests the encrypted queries in the 
cloud storage.
